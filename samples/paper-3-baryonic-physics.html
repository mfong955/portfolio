  <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This paper investigated how non-dark-matter factors&mdash;specifically baryonic physics
    (gas, stars, feedback processes) and massive neutrinos&mdash;affect the cosmological
    signals that future surveys will use to measure the universe's properties. Using the
    BAHAMAS simulation suite, I created synthetic observational catalogs through ray-tracing
    to determine whether these factors would lead to biased scientific conclusions.
  </p>

  <h2 id="data-pipeline">Data Pipeline & Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    This project involved managing a complex, multi-stage simulation and analysis pipeline:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Simulation suite management:</strong> BAHAMAS provides multiple simulation runs
    with different physics configurations (dark-matter-only, with baryons, with neutrinos
    of varying masses), enabling controlled comparisons</li>
    <li><strong>Ray-tracing through light-cones:</strong> Tracing simulated photon paths through
    the simulation volume to generate synthetic weak lensing maps, replicating how real
    telescopes observe the universe</li>
    <li><strong>Synthetic catalog generation:</strong> Converting ray-traced maps into mock
    observational catalogs that mimic the properties of real survey data
    (galaxy positions, shapes, noise characteristics)</li>
    <li><strong>Aperture mass statistics:</strong> Computing peak statistics from the synthetic maps
    to quantify the lensing signal in a way that is sensitive to cosmological parameters</li>
    <li><strong>Sensitivity analysis:</strong> Comparing statistics across simulation configurations
    to isolate the impact of each physical effect</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="info-box highlight">
    <h4>Pipeline Architecture Significance</h4>
    <p>
      This is essentially a large-scale <strong>simulation-to-observation</strong> ETL pipeline
      running on HPC systems. The ray-tracing component alone involves tracing billions of
      light paths through a 3D simulation volume&mdash;a massively parallel computing problem.
      Managing multiple simulation configurations and ensuring apples-to-apples comparisons
      mirrors the challenges of A/B testing and controlled experiments in industry.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="methodology">Statistical Methodology</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Aperture mass statistics:</strong> Filtering-based approach to extract lensing
    signal at multiple angular scales, more robust than direct shear measurement for
    peak identification</li>
    <li><strong>Peak counting:</strong> Identifying and characterizing overdensities in the
    lensing signal as a function of signal-to-noise threshold</li>
    <li><strong>Covariance estimation:</strong> Computing the full covariance matrix of peak
    counts across bins, accounting for cosmic variance and shot noise</li>
    <li><strong>Bias quantification:</strong> Measuring the systematic shift in inferred
    cosmological parameters when baryonic/neutrino effects are ignored</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="data-visualization">Data Visualization</h2>
  <p>
    The figures in this paper demonstrate the ability to communicate complex simulation
    results and sensitivity analyses through thoughtful visual design. Each figure was
    created using Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn) with custom visualization pipelines.

      <span class="figure-title">Figure 1:</span> The NFW filter function <em>Q</em><sub>NFW</sub>(<em>x</em>)
      used for aperture mass statistics. This compensated filter design isolates the weak lensing
      signal from galaxy clusters while suppressing contributions from large-scale structure,
      enabling robust peak identification in noisy convergence maps.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    <strong>Data science approach:</strong> Filter design for signal extraction in noisy data.
    The compensated filter (positive core, negative annulus) is analogous to edge detection
    kernels in image processing, optimized for the expected signal profile of galaxy clusters.

      The correspondence between mass concentrations (bright regions) and S/N peaks demonstrates
      the effectiveness of the aperture mass approach for cluster detection.

  </figure>
  <p>
    <strong>Data science approach:</strong> Multi-layer visualization combining continuous data
    (convergence map), derived statistics (S/N contours), and catalog information (cluster positions).
    This enables visual validation of the peak detection algorithm against known cluster locations.

  </figure>
  <p>
    <strong>Data science approach:</strong> Controlled comparison across simulation configurations,
    analogous to A/B testing in industry. By holding all other parameters constant and varying
    only the physics model, we isolate the causal impact of each effect on the observable statistics.

  <p>
    <strong>Data science approach:</strong> Quantifying systematic biases through relative difference
    metrics. This visualization directly communicates the magnitude of the systematic error that
    would result from ignoring these physical effects in survey analysis pipelines.

  </figure>
  <p>
    <strong>Data science approach:</strong> Feature engineering for parameter inference. The S/N-mass
    relation encodes information about the underlying cosmology, and the mass-dependent impact of
    neutrinos provides a pathway to constrain fundamental physics from observational data.

  <h2 id="results">Key Results</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Baryonic physics significantly suppresses weak lensing peak counts, particularly
    at high signal-to-noise ratios</li>

    baryonic effects but can be distinguished with sufficient data quality</li>
    <li>Ignoring these effects would lead to biased cosmological parameter estimates in
    next-generation surveys, quantifying the systematic error budget</li>
    <li>Provided guidance for future survey analysis pipelines on which physical effects
    must be modeled to achieve target precision</li>
