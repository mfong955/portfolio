  <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
  <p>
    My career spans three intersecting domains. I spent 7+ years as a PhD and postdoctoral researcher in
    physics and astrophysics, applying ML and advanced statistical methods to petabyte-scale datasets
    and publishing findings in top peer-reviewed journals. After academia, I spent 3+ years creating 
    AWS AI/ML developer documentation, API references, and information architecture for Amazon SageMaker 
    services. While at AWS, I designed and built AI-powered tools using LLMs, MCP Protocol, and Python to 
    streamline complex workflows.

    <h4>What Sets My Work Apart</h4>
    <p>
      I combine deep technical understanding with clear, structured communication. Whether building
      AI-powered automation pipelines, documenting ML workflows for developers, or translating
      astrophysics research results for international research audiences, I focus on understanding
      the problem space and delivering evidence-based solutions.

  <h2 id="technical-communication">Technical Communication</h2>
  <p>
    At Amazon Web Services, I owned and created documentation for major SageMaker AI features,
    working directly with engineering teams to validate technical accuracy. My work spanned
    product documentation, architecture guides, and cross-functional process improvements
    that impacted documentation AWS-wide.

      <h3>Technical Communication</h3>
      <p>
        Documentation methodology, tools, and five detailed projects from my work on
        SageMaker AI developer documentation at AWS.

  <h2 id="ai-powered-tools">AI-Powered Tools</h2>
  <p>
    At AWS, I designed and built AI-powered tools that automated complex workflows,
    from multi-stage drafting pipelines to agentic ticket resolution systems. I also
    created and taught AI training courses, achieving 80%+ adoption rates and 30%+
    productivity gains among participants.

      <h3>AI-Powered Tools</h3>
      <p>
        Three AI-powered systems built with Claude, MCP Protocol, and Python&mdash;demonstrating
        LLM integration, prompt engineering, and agentic architectures.

  <h2 id="research-data-science">Research & Data Science</h2>
  <p>
    My doctoral and postdoctoral research focused on applying ML and statistical methods 
    to massive cosmological datasets, including dark matter
    halo dynamics and weak gravitational lensing. This resulted in the discovery and first measurement of a novel physically meaningful 
    dark matter halo parameter. I published 4 first-author papers in
    the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS), applying end-to-end
    data science methods to petabyte-scale datasets.

      <h3>Research & Data Science</h3>
      <p>
        Four first-author publications demonstrating data science, statistical modeling,
        pipeline design, and scientific communication.
