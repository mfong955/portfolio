    <h1>Technical Writing Samples</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      A curated portfolio from 10+ years of technical writing across enterprise cloud
      documentation and peer-reviewed scientific research.

  <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a Technical Writer with 3+ years at AWS creating AI/ML developer documentation,
    API references, user guides, and training materials for the Amazon SageMaker family of services.
    Before AWS, I spent 7+ years as a PhD and postdoctoral researcher in physics and astrophysics,
    applying ML and advanced statistical methods to massive datasets and publishing findings in
    top peer-reviewed journals.
  </p>
  <p>
    This combination of industry documentation experience and scientific research gives me a
    distinctive approach to technical writing: I understand both the enterprise audience looking
    for clear, task-oriented documentation and the research audience that demands rigorous,
    data-driven communication.

    <h4>What Sets My Work Apart</h4>
    <p>
      I combine technical understanding and accessible communication.
      Whether documenting ML workflows for developers, creating AI-powered
      documentation tools, or translating cosmological simulation results for international
      research audiences, I focus on understanding the user's context and delivering information
      that enables action.
    </p>

  <h2 id="aws-work">AWS Documentation</h2>
  <p>
    At Amazon Web Services, I owned and created documentation for major SageMaker AI features,
    working directly with engineering teams to validate technical accuracy. My work spanned
    product documentation, architecture guides, and cross-functional process improvements
    that impacted documentation AWS-wide.

  <h2 id="astrophysics-work">Astrophysics Research</h2>
  <p>
    My doctoral and postdoctoral research focused on cosmological simulations, dark matter
    halo dynamics, and weak gravitational lensing. I published 4 first-author papers in
    the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS), each requiring the ability
    to communicate complex statistical methods and multi-dimensional data analysis to
    specialist and cross-disciplinary audiences.
