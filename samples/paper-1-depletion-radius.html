  <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This paper conducted the first-ever empirical measurement of the "depletion radius"&mdash;a
    physical boundary of dark matter haloes previously identified only in simulations
    (see <a href="{{ '/samples/paper-2-natural-boundary.html' | relative_url }}">Paper 2</a>).
    Using real-world observational data from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, I validated
    that the depletion radius exists in nature, not just in computational models.

  <h2 id="data-pipeline">Data Pipeline & Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    The core technical challenge was designing a pipeline to cross-match massive halo
    catalogs with source galaxy imaging data across different survey releases:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Halo catalog:</strong> Galaxy group catalogs constructed from spectroscopic surveys,
    providing halo mass estimates and positions</li>
    <li><strong>Source imaging:</strong> DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR8 and DR9, providing
    galaxy shape measurements for weak lensing analysis</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-matching:</strong> Spatial matching of lens (halo) and source (background galaxy)
    catalogs across survey footprints with careful selection criteria</li>
    <li><strong>Shear estimation:</strong> Fourier_Quad pipeline for robust shape measurement,
    converting galaxy ellipticities into gravitational shear estimates</li>
    <li><strong>Stacking analysis:</strong> Signal averaging across thousands of halos to extract
    the weak lensing signal with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="info-box highlight">
    <h4>Pipeline Architecture Significance</h4>
    <p>
      This pipeline is essentially a large-scale ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) system:
      ingesting data from multiple astronomical surveys, transforming it through statistical
      processing stages, and producing validated scientific measurements. The cross-matching
      and quality control requirements mirror challenges in enterprise data engineering.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="methodology">Statistical Methodology</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stacked weak lensing:</strong> Combining signals from individual halos to build
    statistically significant radial profiles</li>
    <li><strong>Fourier_Quad shear estimation:</strong> Fourier-space method for measuring
    galaxy shapes, more robust than real-space approaches for noisy data</li>
    <li><strong>MCMC parameter estimation:</strong> Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to fit
    theoretical density profile models and extract characteristic radii with uncertainties</li>
    <li><strong>Profile fitting:</strong> Fitting theoretical density profile models to the
    observed lensing signal to extract characteristic radii</li>
    <li><strong>Statistical validation:</strong> Bootstrap resampling, systematic error estimation,
    and comparison with simulation-based predictions</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="data-visualization">Data Visualization</h2>
  <p>
    The figures in this paper demonstrate the ability to communicate complex observational
    results through thoughtful visual design. Each figure was created using Python
    (Matplotlib, Seaborn) with custom visualization pipelines.

  <p>
    <strong>Data science approach:</strong> Phase-space density estimation using kernel-based methods
    on millions of particle positions and velocities. The layered visualization (density colormap +
    reference lines) encodes multiple data dimensions simultaneously, enabling identification of
    distinct dynamical populations.

      the right panels marks the depletion boundary.

    <strong>Data science approach:</strong> Bayesian parameter estimation using MCMC sampling to fit
    theoretical models to observational data. The multi-panel layout enables direct comparison across
    mass bins, revealing how the depletion radius scales with halo mass. Uncertainty bands communicate
    the precision of the measurements.

    <strong>Data science approach:</strong> Correlation analysis between two derived physical quantities.
    The scatter plot with error bars communicates both the central relationship and the measurement
    uncertainties, enabling assessment of the physical connection between these boundary definitions.
