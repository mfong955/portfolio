    <h4>A Note on Samples</h4>
    <p>
      These tools were built for internal AWS workflows and are not available for external
      demonstration. What I can share is how they worked, the problems they solved, and the
      measurable impact they had. The experience I gained building these systems has only
      deepened since&mdash;I continue to explore and build with new AI capabilities as they emerge.
    </p>

  <h2 id="problem">Problem Solved</h2>
  <div class="info-box highlight">
    <p>
      Documentation tickets often require repetitive analysis: understanding the request,
      locating relevant source files, determining the appropriate fix, and implementing
      changes. This manual process created bottlenecks.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="how-it-worked">How It Worked</h2>
  <p>
    I developed an agentic system that automated ticket analysis and resolution:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ticket parsing:</strong> Takes ticket URL as input, extracts requirements
    and context</li>
    <li><strong>Codebase navigation:</strong> Automatically locates relevant XML source
    files in the documentation repository</li>
    <li><strong>Action planning:</strong> Breaks down the ticket into discrete steps with
    clear acceptance criteria, balancing short-term fixes and longer-term impact</li>
    <li><strong>Multiple output modes:</strong> Can generate diff-style changes, direct
    source XML updates, or flagged sections for human review</li>
    <li><strong>Searchable flags:</strong> Inserts markers in output for easy location
    of changes requiring attention</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduced routine simple ticket resolution time significantly</li>
    <li>Helped identify longer-term underlying documentation issues</li>
    <li>Standardized approach to common documentation fixes</li>
    <li>Freed up writer time for more complex, high-value work</li>
  </ul>
