  <h2 id="context">About These Projects</h2>
  <p>
    At AWS, I designed and built AI-powered systems that automated complex workflows,
    achieving measurable productivity gains. These tools were developed for internal use
    and some were shared across the organization.
  </p>

  <div class="info-box">
    <h4>A Note on Samples</h4>
    <p>
      These tools were built for internal AWS workflows and are not available for external
      demonstration. What I can share is how they worked, the problems they solved, and the
      measurable impact they had. The experience I gained building these systems has only
      deepened since&mdash;I continue to explore and build with new AI capabilities as they emerge.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="training">AI Training Courses</h2>
  <p>
    Beyond building tools, I created and taught AI training courses for AWS employees
    for major AI initiatives:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Prompt engineering fundamentals:</strong> How to write effective prompts
    for documentation tasks and when and how to implement RAG</li>
    <li><strong>Tool development:</strong> Building custom AI workflows for specific
    use cases</li>
    <li><strong>Best practices:</strong> Quality control, fact-checking, and maintaining
    accuracy when using AI assistance</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="info-box success">
    <h4>Training Impact</h4>
    <p>
      Post-course surveys showed <strong>80%+ adoption rates</strong> of the techniques
      taught, with participants reporting <strong>30%+ productivity gains</strong> in
      their workflows.
    </p>

  <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
  <p>
    The following projects demonstrate different aspects of AI-powered tool development,
    from multi-stage pipelines to agentic systems:
  </p>

  <div class="samples-grid">
    <a href="{{ '/samples/ai-drafting-pipeline.html' | relative_url }}" class="sample-card">
      <h3>Multi-Stage AI Drafting Pipeline</h3>
      <p>
        A multi-stage AI pipeline using LLMs and MCP that automated content drafting
        from initial draft through post-review revisions with built-in fact-checking.
      </p>
      <span class="card-link">View project &rarr;</span>
    </a>

    <a href="{{ '/samples/ai-ticket-resolution.html' | relative_url }}" class="sample-card">
      <h3>Agentic Ticket Resolution System</h3>
      <p>
        An agentic system that automated ticket analysis and resolution&mdash;parsing
        requests, navigating codebases, and generating targeted fixes.
      </p>
      <span class="card-link">View project &rarr;</span>
    </a>

    <a href="{{ '/samples/ai-promotion-assistant.html' | relative_url }}" class="sample-card">
      <h3>Promotion Documentation Assistant</h3>
      <p>
        A personal productivity tool that synthesizes accomplishments into structured
        STAR-format narratives for performance review documentation.
      </p>
      <span class="card-link">View project &rarr;</span>
    </a>
  </div>

  <h2 id="skills">Technical Skills Demonstrated</h2>
  <p>Building these tools required combining multiple skill sets:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>LLM Integration:</strong> Which foundation models for which purposes, prompt engineering, context management</li>
    <li><strong>MCP Protocol:</strong> Using tools that extend LLM capabilities</li>
    <li><strong>Python Development:</strong> Automation scripts, API integrations, file processing</li>
    <li><strong>Workflow Design:</strong> Multi-stage pipelines with error handling and human-in-the-loop checkpoints</li>
    <li><strong>Domain Expertise:</strong> Understanding end-user needs and content quality standards to design effective AI-assisted workflows</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="info-box">
    <h4>Continuing to Build</h4>
    <p>
      The AI landscape evolves rapidly, and so does my toolkit. I continue to experiment
      with new capabilities&mdash;from improved reasoning models to multi-agent architectures&mdash;
      always looking for ways to make knowledge workflows more efficient and effective.
