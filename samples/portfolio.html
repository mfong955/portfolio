  <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
  <p>
    My career spans three intersecting domains. At AWS, I spent 3+ years creating AI/ML developer
    documentation, API references, and information architecture for Amazon SageMaker services. In
    parallel, I designed and built AI-powered tools using LLMs, MCP Protocol, and Python to automate
    complex workflows. Before industry, I spent 7+ years as a PhD and postdoctoral researcher in
    physics and astrophysics, applying ML and advanced statistical methods to petabyte-scale datasets
    and publishing findings in top peer-reviewed journals.

    <h4>What Sets My Work Apart</h4>
    <p>
      I combine deep technical understanding with clear, structured communication. Whether building
      AI-powered automation pipelines, documenting ML workflows for developers, or translating
      cosmological simulation results for international research audiences, I focus on understanding
      the problem space and delivering work that enables action.

  <h2 id="technical-communication">Technical Communication</h2>
  <p>
    At Amazon Web Services, I owned and created documentation for major SageMaker AI features,
    working directly with engineering teams to validate technical accuracy. My work spanned
    product documentation, architecture guides, and cross-functional process improvements
    that impacted documentation AWS-wide.

      <h3>Technical Communication</h3>
      <p>
        Documentation methodology, tools, and five detailed projects from my work on
        SageMaker AI developer documentation at AWS.

  <h2 id="ai-ml-engineering">AI/ML Engineering</h2>
  <p>
    At AWS, I designed and built AI-powered tools that automated complex workflows,
    from multi-stage drafting pipelines to agentic ticket resolution systems. I also
    created and taught AI training courses, achieving 80%+ adoption rates and 30%+
    productivity gains among participants.

      <h3>AI/ML Engineering Projects</h3>
      <p>
        Three AI-powered systems built with Claude, MCP Protocol, and Python—demonstrating
        LLM integration, prompt engineering, and agentic architectures.

  <h2 id="research-data-science">Research & Data Science</h2>
  <p>
    My doctoral and postdoctoral research focused on cosmological simulations, dark matter
    halo dynamics, and weak gravitational lensing. I published 4 first-author papers in
    the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS), applying end-to-end
    data science methods to petabyte-scale datasets.

      <h3>Research & Data Science</h3>
      <p>
        Four first-author publications demonstrating data science, statistical modeling,
        pipeline design, and scientific communication.
