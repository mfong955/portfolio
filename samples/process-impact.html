  <h2 id="problem">The Problem</h2>
  <p>
    From my first days at Amazon SageMaker AI, a consistent theme emerged: the team, PMs, and
    engineers all struggled with the onboarding documentation. Getting started with SageMaker
    meant navigating through complex IAM (Identity and Access Management) configurations,
    domain setup, and service prerequisites—and the existing documentation wasn't making
    this journey smooth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rather than accepting this as "just how it is," I decided to systematically investigate
    and address the root causes.
  </p>

  <h2 id="approach">My Approach</h2>

  <h3>Phase 1: Deep Dive into User Journeys</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Identified and documented all personas using SageMaker AI—from individual data
    scientists to enterprise administrators</li>
    <li>Walked through each persona's workflow step-by-step, taking careful notes on pain
    points, confusion, and gaps</li>
    <li>Created documentation improvements for SageMaker-specific onboarding paths</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Phase 2: Identifying Systemic Issues</h3>
  <p>
    While improving SageMaker documentation, I discovered the friction wasn't just in our
    docs—it was rooted in how AWS IAM (a foundational service used by all AWS products)
    handled certain onboarding scenarios. The IAM documentation and entity configurations
    were creating friction for users across multiple AWS services, not just SageMaker.
  </p>

  <h3>Phase 3: Cross-Team Collaboration</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Documented my findings and proposed solutions with clear evidence</li>
    <li>Reached out to the AWS IAM team to share my analysis</li>
    <li>Collaborated with IAM to update the underlying entity and documentation</li>
    <li>Changes were adopted and rolled out across AWS documentation</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="info-box success">
    <h4>Impact</h4>
    <p>
      The IAM improvements I identified and helped implement impacted documentation and
      user experience across all of AWS—not just SageMaker. This represents the kind of
      systemic thinking that improves the entire platform, not just one product.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="demonstrates">What This Work Demonstrates</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Systems thinking:</strong> Looking beyond immediate symptoms to identify
    root causes, even when they cross team boundaries</li>
    <li><strong>Initiative:</strong> Taking ownership of problems that "everyone knows about"
    but no one has tackled</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-functional influence:</strong> Building relationships and driving
    change across organizational boundaries without direct authority</li>
    <li><strong>User advocacy:</strong> Prioritizing actual user experience over internal
    convenience</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="structure">Documentation Structure (SageMaker Setting Up)</h2>
  <p>The improved SageMaker onboarding documentation I developed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Setting up SageMaker AI</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete Amazon SageMaker AI prerequisites</li>
        <li>Use quick setup — Streamlined path for simple use cases</li>
        <li>Use custom setup — Detailed path for enterprise requirements</li>
        <li>Domain overview
          <ul>
            <li>SageMaker AI domain entities</li>
            <li>Choose an Amazon VPC</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Supported Regions and Quotas</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <div class="info-box highlight">
    <h4>Unpublished Work</h4>
    <p>
      A larger revamp of the "Setting up SageMaker AI" documentation was completed and
      reviewed with the PM, but was unable to be published before my departure. The
      improvements described here represent the foundation of that larger effort.

  <h2>Broader Context</h2>
  <p>
    This work exemplifies my approach to technical writing: documentation isn't just about
    describing features—it's about understanding user journeys and removing obstacles,
    wherever they exist. Sometimes the most valuable documentation work happens at the
    boundaries between teams and products.
