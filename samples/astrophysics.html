    <h1>Research & Data Science</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      Four peer-reviewed publications in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical
      Society (MNRAS), each demonstrating end-to-end data science, advanced statistical
      modeling, and the ability to communicate complex findings to diverse technical audiences.

  <h2 id="research-context">Research Context</h2>
  <p>
    My doctoral and postdoctoral research (2014&ndash;2022) focused on the large-scale
    structure of the universe, using cosmological simulations and observational data to
    study dark matter halo dynamics. This work sits at the intersection of
    <strong>high-performance computing (HPC)</strong>, <strong>big data</strong> (petabyte-scale simulations),
    and <strong>advanced statistical modeling</strong>.

  <h2 id="technical-methods">Technical Methods & Tools</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Programming:</strong> Python (7+ years), including NumPy, SciPy, and custom analysis pipelines</li>
    <li><strong>Statistical methods:</strong> MCMC sampling, Gaussian Process Regression, Bayesian parameter
    estimation with full covariance matrices, signal-to-noise optimization</li>
    <li><strong>Machine learning:</strong> Model selection, density estimation, parameterized profile fitting
    (NFW vs. DK models), feature engineering from high-dimensional phase-space data</li>
    <li><strong>Data visualization:</strong> Matplotlib and Seaborn for publication-quality figures,
    custom multi-panel layouts, contour mapping, and phase-space density visualizations</li>
    <li><strong>Technical writing:</strong> LaTeX for all publications, structured scientific writing
    for international peer review</li>
    <li><strong>Data scale:</strong> 8+ billion particles from N-body cosmological simulations,
    cross-matched with multi-survey observational catalogs</li>
    <li><strong>Computing:</strong> HPC cluster environments for simulation processing and ray-tracing pipelines</li>
  </ul>

    <h4>What This Work Demonstrates</h4>
    <p>
      This research required end-to-end problem solving: designing data pipelines from raw
      simulation output to analysis-ready catalogs, applying advanced statistical methods to
      extract signal from noise, and communicating results clearly for international peer review.
      The same skills&mdash;structured thinking, pipeline design, statistical rigor, and clear
      communication&mdash;apply directly to industry work in data science, AI/ML, and technical
      communication.

  <div class="info-box">
    <h4>Cross-Domain Skills</h4>
    <p>
      This research involved end-to-end pipeline design (from raw simulation data to synthetic catalogs),
      statistical inference at scale, model selection and validation, and petabyte-scale data processing
      on HPC systems. It also required translating complex mathematical concepts into structured
      narratives, creating effective data visualizations, and communicating methodology clearly for
      diverse technical audiences&mdash;skills that transfer directly to industry roles in data science,
      AI-powered tool development, and technical communication.
