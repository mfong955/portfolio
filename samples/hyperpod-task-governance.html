    <h4>Note on Live Documentation</h4>
    <p>
      As with all actively maintained documentation, these pages may have been updated by
      other contributors since original publication. The structure and approach I established
      continue to serve as the foundation for this documentation node.
    </p>

  <h2 id="challenge">The Challenge</h2>
  <p>
    Enterprise organizations running large-scale AI/ML training workloads need sophisticated
    tools to manage compute resources across distributed clusters. SageMaker HyperPod task
    governance enables administrators to control how training jobs are scheduled, prioritized,
    and allocated across GPU-intensive infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>
    This documentation required explaining complex distributed systems concepts—task scheduling,
    resource allocation policies, GPU partition quotas—to administrators who may have varying
    levels of familiarity with Kubernetes and cluster management.
  </p>

  <h2 id="approach">My Approach</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rapid domain learning:</strong> Deep-dived into a topic I was initially
    unfamiliar with on a tight timeline, building reliable relationships with the HyperPod
    team to understand the system architecture.</li>
    <li><strong>PM and engineering partnership:</strong> Worked closely with product managers
    to understand the user personas and their needs, then collaborated with engineers to
    ensure technical accuracy of complex administrative procedures.</li>
    <li><strong>Conference deadline:</strong> Delivered high-quality documentation ready for
    AWS re:Invent, one of the largest cloud computing conferences.</li>
    <li><strong>Task-oriented structure:</strong> Organized content around what administrators
    actually need to do, not just what the features are.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="structure">Documentation Structure</h2>
  <p>I designed a task-oriented architecture that matches administrator workflows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Task governance</strong> — Overview and concepts
      <ul>
        <li>Setup
          <ul>
            <li>Dashboard setup — Monitoring interface configuration</li>
            <li>Task governance setup — Initial configuration</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Dashboard — Real-time monitoring and insights</li>
        <li>Tasks
          <ul>
            <li>Scheduling — Job queue management</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Policies
          <ul>
            <li>Create policies — Define governance rules</li>
            <li>Edit policies — Modify existing rules</li>
            <li>Delete policies — Clean up unused policies</li>
            <li>Compute allocation
              <ul>
                <li>GPU partition quota — Hardware resource limits</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Example commands — Ready-to-use CLI examples</li>
        <li>Troubleshoot — Common issues and solutions</li>
        <li>Attribution — Credits and references</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <div class="info-box highlight">
    <h4>What This Demonstrates</h4>
    <p>
      Ability to quickly learn complex technical domains, document enterprise-scale distributed
      systems, work effectively under deadline pressure, and structure documentation around
      user tasks rather than product features.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="concepts">Key Concepts Explained</h2>
  <p>The documentation had to make several complex concepts accessible:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Task scheduling in distributed environments:</strong> How jobs are queued,
    prioritized, and assigned to compute nodes</li>
    <li><strong>Policy-based governance:</strong> Creating rules that automatically enforce
    resource limits and access controls</li>
    <li><strong>GPU partition quotas:</strong> Allocating fractional GPU resources across
    teams and workloads</li>
    <li><strong>EKS integration:</strong> How HyperPod task governance works with
    Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service</li>
  </ul>
