    <p>
      As with all actively maintained documentation, these pages may have been updated by
      other contributors since original publication. The core structure and approach I
      established remain the foundation of these documentation nodes.

  <h2 id="challenge">The Challenge</h2>
  <p>
    Trusted Identity Propagation addresses a critical enterprise need: maintaining user identity
    context as data scientists work across multiple AWS services. Before this feature, enterprises
    faced significant challenges:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Identity fragmentation:</strong> Users had to manage multiple IAM roles when
    accessing different AWS services, losing their individual identity context</li>
    <li><strong>Audit complexity:</strong> Tracking which specific user performed actions across
    services was difficult when all actions appeared under shared execution roles</li>
    <li><strong>Access control limitations:</strong> Fine-grained permissions based on user
    attributes (like group membership) were hard to implement across service boundaries</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-team coordination:</strong> Setting up the feature required collaboration
    between SageMaker administrators and IAM Identity Center administrators</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="approach">My Approach</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Multi-audience documentation:</strong> Created separate paths for SageMaker
    administrators and IAM Identity Center administrators, recognizing that setup requires
    collaboration between different teams with different expertise.</li>
    <li><strong>Architecture-first explanation:</strong> Started with clear architecture
    documentation to help readers understand how identity context flows between services
    before diving into configuration steps.</li>
    <li><strong>Service-specific integration guides:</strong> Created dedicated pages for each
    connected service (S3 Access Grants, EMR, EMR Serverless, Redshift Data API, Lake Formation,
    Athena) with service-specific prerequisites and configuration.</li>
    <li><strong>Security and compliance focus:</strong> Emphasized auditing capabilities with
    CloudTrail integration, helping enterprises meet compliance requirements.</li>
    <li><strong>Edge case documentation:</strong> Documented user background sessions and
    other advanced scenarios that enterprise users would encounter.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="structure">Documentation Structure</h2>
  <p>I designed an information architecture that guides administrators through the complex setup process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Trusted identity propagation</strong> — Overview and use cases
      <ul>
        <li>Architecture and compatibility — Technical architecture, prerequisites</li>
        <li>Set up — Configuration steps for both SageMaker and IAM Identity Center</li>
        <li>Audit with CloudTrail — Compliance and monitoring</li>
        <li>User background sessions — Advanced session management</li>
        <li>Connect with other AWS services — Integration guides
          <ul>
            <li>Connect to Amazon S3 Access Grants
              <ul>
                <li>Studio JupyterLab notebooks with Amazon S3 Access Grants</li>
                <li>Training and Processing jobs with Amazon S3 Access Grants</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Connect to Amazon EMR</li>
            <li>Connect to EMR Serverless</li>
            <li>Connect to Redshift Data API</li>
            <li>Connect to Lake Formation and Athena</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="technical-depth">Technical Depth</h2>
  <p>
    This documentation required deep understanding of enterprise identity management and
    cross-service AWS architecture:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>IAM Identity Center integration:</strong> Documented how user attributes and
    group associations flow from Identity Center to connected services</li>
    <li><strong>Token exchange mechanisms:</strong> Explained how identity context is propagated
    without requiring users to re-authenticate</li>
    <li><strong>Service-specific authorization:</strong> Each connected service has different
    authorization models that needed to be documented clearly</li>
    <li><strong>CloudTrail event structure:</strong> Documented how to interpret audit logs
    to track user-specific actions across services</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="connected-services">Connected Services Documentation</h2>
  <p>
    A major component of this work was documenting integrations with multiple AWS services,
    each with unique requirements:
  </p>
  <div class="info-box">
    <h4>Service Integrations Documented</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Amazon S3 Access Grants:</strong> Fine-grained data access for notebooks,
      training jobs, and processing jobs</li>
      <li><strong>Amazon EMR:</strong> Cluster-based big data processing with identity propagation</li>
      <li><strong>EMR Serverless:</strong> Serverless Spark and Hive with user identity context</li>
      <li><strong>Redshift Data API:</strong> Data warehouse queries with user-level auditing</li>
      <li><strong>Lake Formation and Athena:</strong> Data lake access with fine-grained permissions</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2 id="enterprise-focus">Enterprise Focus</h2>
  <p>
    This documentation was specifically designed for enterprise customers with complex
    identity and compliance requirements:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Compliance enablement:</strong> Detailed CloudTrail integration for audit trails</li>
    <li><strong>Least privilege support:</strong> User attribute-based access control</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-team workflows:</strong> Clear handoff points between admin teams</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability considerations:</strong> Documentation for large-scale deployments</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="info-box highlight">
    <h4>What This Demonstrates</h4>
    <p>
      Ability to document complex enterprise security features spanning multiple AWS services.
      Experience with identity management, IAM, and cross-service authorization patterns.
      Skill in creating documentation for multiple technical audiences (SageMaker admins,
      IAM Identity Center admins, security engineers). Understanding of enterprise compliance
      and auditing requirements.
