  <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This paper was a <strong>feasibility study</strong> for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
    (LSST, now Vera C. Rubin Observatory). The core question: will next-generation survey data
    have sufficient quality to distinguish between the traditional NFW density profile model
    (used for 20+ years) and the newer DK profile (which incorporates the physics of mass
    accretion)? This is fundamentally a <strong>model selection and forecasting</strong> problem.
  </p>

  <h2 id="data-pipeline">Data Pipeline</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Simulation source:</strong> Cosmo-OWLS simulations providing realistic halo density
    profiles with full baryonic physics</li>
    <li><strong>Synthetic lensing generation:</strong> Creating mock weak lensing measurements
    with realistic noise properties matching LSST specifications (source density, shape noise,
    photometric redshift errors)</li>
    <li><strong>Profile fitting:</strong> Fitting both NFW and DK models to the synthetic data using
    Bayesian parameter estimation</li>
    <li><strong>Signal-to-noise forecasting:</strong> Computing how profile distinguishability scales with
    survey depth, source density, and halo mass</li>
  </ul>

    <h4>Industry Parallel: Technology Evaluation</h4>
    <p>
      This paper is structurally a <strong>technology evaluation / competitive analysis</strong>:
      given a new "product" (DK profile) and a market standard (NFW profile), under what
      conditions does the new product demonstrably outperform? The methodology&mdash;synthetic
      data generation, controlled comparison, sensitivity to deployment conditions&mdash;maps
      directly to product feasibility studies and A/B test design.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="methodology">Statistical Methodology</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bayesian model comparison:</strong> Computing Bayesian evidence for NFW vs. DK profiles
    to determine which model is preferred by the data</li>
    <li><strong>Signal-to-noise forecasting:</strong> Predicting the survey conditions under which the
    DK profile becomes statistically distinguishable from NFW</li>
    <li><strong>Parameter degeneracy analysis:</strong> Identifying which DK profile parameters are
    well-constrained vs. degenerate with observational uncertainties</li>
    <li><strong>Parameterized accretion modeling:</strong> The DK profile encodes the mass accretion
    history of haloes through its outer slope parameter, providing physical information
    not available from NFW fits</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="data-visualization">Data Visualization</h2>
  <p>
    The figures in this paper demonstrate the ability to communicate model comparison results
    and feasibility assessments through thoughtful visual design. Each figure was created
    using Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn) with custom visualization pipelines.

  <h3 id="figure-1">Figure 1: NFW vs. DK Profile Comparison</h3>
  <figure class="figure">

      profiles showing 3D mass density (top), convergence (middle), and shear (bottom) as functions
      of radius. The vertical red line marks <em>r</em><sub>200c</sub>. The profiles agree well within
      the virial radius but diverge significantly in the outer regions where the DK profile captures
      the steepening due to the splashback radius.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    <strong>Data science approach:</strong> Multi-panel comparison of theoretical models across
    different observable quantities. The stacked layout enables direct visual comparison of where
    the models agree (inner regions) and diverge (outer regions), informing where observational
    data will have the most discriminating power.
  </p>

      form is self-similar (all parameters collapse to one curve), while the DK form shows parameter
      dependence in the outer regions. The vertical dashed line marks a typical weak lensing fit radius.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    <strong>Data science approach:</strong> Dimensionless scaling to reveal universal behavior.
    By plotting the scaled shear form, we identify which aspects of the profile are universal
    (NFW self-similarity) versus parameter-dependent (DK outer regions), informing the fitting
    strategy and parameter constraints.

      mass estimates, particularly for the most massive clusters.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    <strong>Data science approach:</strong> Model validation through comparison with ground truth.
    The scatter plot with identity line enables visual assessment of bias (systematic offset from
    the line) and precision (scatter around the line) for each model, directly informing which
    model provides more accurate mass estimates.

      arrows indicating the projected principal axes (1 = major, 2 = intermediate, 3 = minor).
      The major axis appears shortest in projection because it lies close to the line of sight,
      demonstrating how triaxiality can lead to large errors in mass estimation when using
      spherical models.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    <strong>Data science approach:</strong> Visualization of systematic effects. By overlaying
    the 3D shape information (principal axes) on the 2D observable (convergence map), we
    communicate how projection effects can bias mass estimates, motivating the need for
    stacking analyses that average over random orientations.

      from multiple clusters to increase signal-to-noise. The DK profile provides a better description
      of the outer regions, where the density steepening due to the splashback radius becomes apparent.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    <strong>Data science approach:</strong> Signal averaging to increase statistical power. Stacking
    is analogous to ensemble methods in machine learning&mdash;by combining many noisy individual
    measurements, we extract a cleaner signal that reveals the underlying model behavior.
