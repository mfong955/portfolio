    <h4>A Note on Samples</h4>
    <p>
      These tools were built for internal AWS workflows and are not available for external
      demonstration. What I can share is how they worked, the problems they solved, and the
      measurable impact they had. The experience I gained building these systems has only
      deepened since&mdash;I continue to explore and build with new AI capabilities as they emerge.

  <div class="info-box highlight">
    <p>
      Performance review and promotion documentation requires synthesizing months of
      accomplishments into structured narratives&mdash;a deeply time-consuming process.

  <h2 id="how-it-worked">How It Worked</h2>
  <p>
    A personal productivity tool I built to streamline my own promotion preparation:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accomplishment ingestion:</strong> Accepts unstructured notes, bullet
    points, and raw accomplishment data</li>
    <li><strong>Format knowledge:</strong> Uses company's promotion documents
    and evaluation criteria</li>
    <li><strong>Narrative generation:</strong> Transforms raw inputs into structured
    stories with clear impact statements</li>
    <li><strong>STAR format:</strong> Automatically structures content into Situation,
    Task, Action, Result format</li>
  </ul>
