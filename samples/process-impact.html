  <h2 id="problem">The Problem</h2>
  <p>
    From my first days at Amazon SageMaker AI, a consistent theme emerged: Not only me, but the team, PMs, and
    engineers all struggled with the onboarding documentation. Getting started with SageMaker AI
    meant navigating through complex IAM (Identity and Access Management) setup,
    domain setup, and service prerequisites—and the existing documentation wasn't making
    this journey smooth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rather than accepting this as just how it is, I decided to systematically investigate
    and address the root causes.
  </p>

  <h2 id="approach">My Approach</h2>

  <h3>Phase 1: Deep Dive into User Journeys</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Identified and documented all personas using SageMaker AI—from individual data
    scientists to enterprise administrators</li>
    <li>Walked through each persona's workflow step-by-step, taking careful notes on pain
    points, confusion, and gaps</li>
    <li>Created documentation improvements for SageMaker AI-specific onboarding paths</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Phase 2: Identifying Systemic Issues</h3>
  <p>
    While improving SageMaker AI documentation, I discovered the friction wasn't just in our
    docs—it was rooted in how the AWS IAM (a foundational service used by all AWS products)
    onboarding documentation handled certain onboarding scenarios. The IAM documentation is 
    deployed AWS-wide through an entity, so by identifying the friction points there I 
    was identifying them across all onboarding docs for AWS services, not just SageMaker AI.
  </p>

  <h3>Phase 3: Cross-Team Collaboration</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Documented my findings and proposed solutions with clear persona paths</li>
    <li>Reached out to the AWS IAM team to share my analysis</li>
    <li>Collaborated with IAM to update the underlying entity and documentation</li>
    <li>Changes were adopted and rolled out across AWS documentation</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="info-box success">
    <h4>Impact</h4>
    <p>
      The IAM improvements I identified and helped implement impacted documentation and
      user experience across all of AWS—not just SageMaker AI. This improves the entire 
      platform, not just one service.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="demonstrates">What This Work Demonstrates</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Systems thinking:</strong> Looking beyond immediate symptoms to identify
    root causes, even when they cross team boundaries</li>
    <li><strong>Initiative:</strong> Taking ownership of problems that "everyone knows about"
    but no one has tackled</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-functional influence:</strong> Building relationships and driving
    change across organizational boundaries without direct authority</li>
    <li><strong>User advocacy:</strong> Prioritizing actual user experience over internal
    convenience</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="structure">Documentation Structure (SageMaker AI Setting Up)</h2>
  <p>The improved SageMaker AI onboarding documentation I developed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Setting up SageMaker AI</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete Amazon SageMaker AI prerequisites</li>
        <li>Use quick setup — Streamlined path for simple use cases</li>
        <li>Use custom setup — Detailed path for enterprise requirements</li>
        <li>Domain overview
          <ul>
            <li>SageMaker AI domain entities</li>
            <li>Choose an Amazon VPC</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Supported Regions and Quotas</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <div class="info-box highlight">
    <h4>Unpublished Work</h4>
    <p>
      A larger revamp of the "Setting up SageMaker AI" documentation was completed and
      reviewed with the PM, but with the sudden departure I was unable to publish. The
      improvements described above represent just the beginning of that larger effort.

  <h2>Broader Context</h2>
  <p>
    This work exemplifies my approach to technical writing: documentation isn't just about
    describing features—it's about understanding user journeys and removing obstacles,
    wherever they exist. Sometimes the most valuable documentation work happens at the
    boundaries between teams and products.
