  <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This paper investigated how non-dark-matter factors&mdash;specifically baryonic physics
    (gas, stars, feedback processes) and massive neutrinos&mdash;affect the cosmological
    signals that future surveys will use to measure the universe's properties. Using the
    BAHAMAS simulation suite, I created synthetic observational catalogs through ray-tracing
    to determine whether these factors would lead to biased scientific conclusions.

  <h2 id="data-pipeline">Data Pipeline & Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    This project involved managing a complex, multi-stage simulation and analysis pipeline:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Simulation suite management:</strong> BAHAMAS provides multiple simulation runs
    with different physics configurations (dark-matter-only, with baryons, with neutrinos
    of varying masses), enabling controlled comparisons</li>
    <li><strong>Ray-tracing through light-cones:</strong> Tracing simulated photon paths through
    the simulation volume to generate synthetic weak lensing maps, replicating how real
    telescopes observe the universe</li>
    <li><strong>Synthetic catalog generation:</strong> Converting ray-traced maps into mock
    observational catalogs that mimic the properties of real survey data
    (galaxy positions, shapes, noise characteristics)</li>
    <li><strong>Aperture mass statistics:</strong> Computing peak statistics from the synthetic maps
    to quantify the lensing signal in a way that is sensitive to cosmological parameters</li>
    <li><strong>Sensitivity analysis:</strong> Comparing statistics across simulation configurations
    to isolate the impact of each physical effect</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="info-box highlight">
    <h4>Pipeline Architecture Significance</h4>
    <p>
      This is essentially a large-scale <strong>simulation-to-observation</strong> ETL pipeline
      running on HPC systems. The ray-tracing component alone involves tracing billions of
      light paths through a 3D simulation volume&mdash;a massively parallel computing problem.
      Managing multiple simulation configurations and ensuring apples-to-apples comparisons
      mirrors the challenges of A/B testing and controlled experiments in industry.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="methodology">Statistical Methodology</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Aperture mass statistics:</strong> Filtering-based approach to extract lensing
    signal at multiple angular scales, more robust than direct shear measurement for
    peak identification</li>
    <li><strong>Peak counting:</strong> Identifying and characterizing overdensities in the
    lensing signal as a function of signal-to-noise threshold</li>
    <li><strong>Covariance estimation:</strong> Computing the full covariance matrix of peak
    counts across bins, accounting for cosmic variance and shot noise</li>
    <li><strong>Bias quantification:</strong> Measuring the systematic shift in inferred
    cosmological parameters when baryonic/neutrino effects are ignored</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="results">Key Results</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Baryonic physics significantly suppresses weak lensing peak counts, particularly
    at high signal-to-noise ratios</li>
    <li>Massive neutrinos produce a distinct signature that is partially degenerate with
    baryonic effects but can be distinguished with sufficient data quality</li>
    <li>Ignoring these effects would lead to biased cosmological parameter estimates in
    next-generation surveys, quantifying the systematic error budget</li>
    <li>Provided guidance for future survey analysis pipelines on which physical effects
    must be modeled to achieve target precision</li>
  </ul>
