  <h2>The Challenge</h2>
  <p>
    Enterprise administrators and ML engineers often need to standardize their development
    environments across teams—specific Python versions, pre-installed libraries, security
    configurations. Before this documentation existed, there was no comprehensive guide for
    bringing custom Docker images into SageMaker AI Studio or SageMaker Unified Studio.
  </p>
  <p>
    I authored the complete documentation node from scratch for both platforms, covering
    everything from image specifications to advanced optimization techniques.
  </p>

  <h2>My Approach</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hands-on testing:</strong> I worked through every workflow myself, often with
    a more basic setup than the engineering team, which helped me identify edge cases and
    common pitfalls users would encounter.</li>
    <li><strong>Engineering collaboration:</strong> Found issues in the original workflow
    examples and proposed solutions. Engineering and I iterated together to create the most
    efficient, error-free how-to guides.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-service strategy:</strong> Coordinated with the SageMaker Unified Studio
    team to handle overlapping content while serving each platform's unique requirements.</li>
    <li><strong>AI-assisted validation:</strong> Used AI assistance to troubleshoot issues
    in workflow examples, finding solutions that weren't immediately obvious from
    engineering's reference environment.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Documentation Structure</h2>
  <p>I designed an information architecture that guides users from basic concepts to advanced optimization:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bring your own image (BYOI)</strong> — Overview and use cases
      <ul>
        <li>Image specifications — Technical requirements</li>
        <li>How to BYOI — Step-by-step workflows
          <ul>
            <li>Create a custom image and push to Amazon ECR</li>
            <li>Attach your custom image to your domain</li>
            <li>Update container configuration</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Launch a custom image in Studio</li>
        <li>View your custom image details</li>
        <li>Speed up container startup with SOCI — Advanced optimization
          <ul>
            <li>Permissions for SOCI indexing</li>
            <li>Create SOCI indexes with nerdctl and SOCI CLI example</li>
            <li>Integrate SOCI-indexed images with Studio example</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Detach and clean up custom image resources</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Lifecycle configurations</strong> — Related automation</li>
  </ul>

    <h4>What This Demonstrates</h4>
    <p>
      Technical depth in AI/ML containerization workflows, ability to structure complex
      how-to content, developer empathy (testing from a user's perspective), and effective
      cross-team collaboration with engineering.

    <h4>Note on Live Documentation</h4>
    <p>
      As with all actively maintained documentation, these pages may have been updated by
      other contributors since original publication. The core structure and approach I
      established remain the foundation of these documentation nodes.
