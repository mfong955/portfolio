  <h2 id="about">About This Work</h2>
  <p>
    My PhD and postdoctoral research focused on cosmological simulations and dark matter halo
    dynamics. This work required processing billions of data points and presenting complex
    Bayesian statistical analyses in ways that could be understood by researchers across
    different specializations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The figures below are from my paper <em>"A natural boundary of dark matter haloes revealed
    around the minimum bias and maximum infall locations"</em>, published in MNRAS. Each figure
    represents a different approach to visualizing multi-dimensional statistical relationships.

    <h4>What This Demonstrates</h4>
    <p>
      Ability to distill complex multi-parameter analyses into clear visual narratives.
      These skills translate directly to creating architecture diagrams, workflow visualizations,
      and data-driven content in technical documentation.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="figure-1">Figure 1: Multi-Parameter Bias Profiles</h2>
  <figure class="figure">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/figures/figure1-bias-profiles.png' | relative_url }}"
         alt="Six-panel plot showing halo bias profiles as functions of radius, binned by different halo parameters including mass, velocity ratio, spin, shape, formation time, and environment density."
         loading="lazy">
    <figcaption class="figure-caption">
      <span class="figure-title">Figure 1:</span> The halo bias profile as a function of radius,
      binned by various halo parameters. Each panel shows the bias binned by a different parameter
      (labeled top right). The ubiquitous trough visible across all panels defines a characteristic
      "depletion boundary"—a key finding of the research.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    <strong>Visual design choices:</strong> Six-panel grid allows direct comparison across
    parameters. Consistent color gradients indicate parameter progression. Log-scale axes
    handle the large dynamic range while maintaining readability. The horizontal dotted line
    provides a visual anchor at unity bias.
  </p>

  <h2 id="figure-4">Figure 4: Two-Parameter Space Mapping</h2>
  <figure class="figure">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/figures/figure4-2d-parameter-space.png' | relative_url }}"
         alt="Grid of 2D contour plots showing characteristic depletion radius values across different combinations of halo parameters, with contour lines and shaded regions indicating parameter distributions."
         loading="lazy">
    <figcaption class="figure-caption">
      <span class="figure-title">Figure 4:</span> The characteristic depletion radius (<em>r</em><sub>cd</sub>)
      for haloes binned by pairs of properties. Gray filled contours show the number density
      distribution of haloes. Thin solid lines are measured <em>r</em><sub>cd</sub> values; thick transparent lines
      are predictions from a Gaussian Process Regression model.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    <strong>Visual design choices:</strong> This 6×6 matrix visualization enables readers to
    quickly identify which parameter combinations most strongly influence the measured quantity.
    The overlay of measured values (thin lines) against model predictions (thick lines) makes
    it immediately apparent where the model succeeds or fails—no need to compare separate figures.
  </p>

  <h2 id="figure-8">Figure 8: Theory Illustration</h2>
  <figure class="figure">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/figures/figure8-theory-illustration.png' | relative_url }}"
         alt="Illustration of halo accretion around the maximum inflow location, showing mass flow magnitudes and halo evolution from initial state (solid black) to evolved state (dashed red)."
         loading="lazy">
    <figcaption class="figure-caption">
      <span class="figure-title">Figure 8:</span> Illustration of halo accretion around the
      maximum inflow location. The maximum inflow location (or inner depletion edge) is
      represented by the vertical dotted line, while horizontal arrows represent mass flow
      magnitudes around this location (see Figure 7). The evolution of the halo is shown
      by the transition from the solid black line to the dashed red line. The density profile
      grows within the maximum inflow radius but decreases outside it.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    <strong>Visual design choices:</strong> This conceptual illustration bridges the gap between
    raw data and physical interpretation. By showing the before/after states with clear directional
    arrows, readers can immediately grasp how matter flows toward the halo center while the outer
    regions become depleted—a key insight that would be difficult to convey through data plots alone.
  </p>

  <h2 id="figure-9">Figure 9: Phase Space Dynamics</h2>
  <figure class="figure">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/figures/figure9-phase-space.png' | relative_url }}"
         alt="Three-panel visualization showing scaled radial velocity distribution for different halo mass bins, with particle density shown as a color map and white contours marking isodensity levels."
         loading="lazy">
    <figcaption class="figure-caption">
      <span class="figure-title">Figure 9:</span> The scaled radial velocity distribution
      for three mass bins, showing 100 randomly selected haloes each. Color maps show particle
      density; white curves mark isodensity contours (99%, 80%, 60%). Vertical lines indicate
      key physical radii (depletion, splashback, virial).
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    <strong>Visual design choices:</strong> Phase space diagrams are notoriously difficult
    to interpret. Here, the density colormapping with layered contours allows readers to
    perceive both the overall structure and quantitative boundaries. The consistent vertical
    line annotations across panels enable direct comparison of how physical boundaries shift
    with halo mass.
