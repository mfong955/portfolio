# Figure Images

This folder should contain the extracted figures from your astrophysics paper.

## Required Files

Extract these figures from your paper and save them here:

1. **figure1-bias-profiles.png** - Figure 1 (the 6-panel bias profiles showing halo parameters)
2. **figure4-2d-parameter-space.png** - Figure 4 (the 6×6 grid showing r_cd values across parameter combinations)
3. **figure9-phase-space.png** - Figure 9 (the 3-panel phase space velocity distributions)

## How to Extract

### Option 1: PDF Export Tool
1. Open the paper PDF
2. Use "Export as Images" or similar feature
3. Select pages containing the figures
4. Crop to just the figure
5. Save as PNG at 1200px+ width

### Option 2: Screenshot
1. Open PDF at high zoom level
2. Take screenshot of just the figure
3. Save as PNG

### Option 3: Original Source
If you still have the matplotlib code that generated these figures, re-export at web resolution.
